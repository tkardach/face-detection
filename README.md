# Facial Detection and Recognition

This repository contains facial detection modules and facial recognition modules I've created through researching the topic. 

The actual facial detection and recognition is not done by me, I have just organized all of my findings into clean classes which are ready to use and can help you with your understanding through your research into the subject.

# Facial Detection

There are 3 methods used for facial detection here.

1. OpenCV's Haar-cascade method 
1. OpenCV's Deep Neural Network method
1. MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network) method


I have personally found that the MTCNN is the most accurate for still images (which is my purpose for the project). As for live detection, you are probably better off using OpenCV's DNN method
